Leading streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus, use recommendation systems to provide suggestions to users of films 
that they predict they will enjoy. This is an especially difficult task in the case of movies that haven’t been seen by a wide audience yet.
The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has made available its data on movies released between 2006 - 2016, including their popularity ranking as recorded by users 
on their website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gan2gan/1000-imdb-movies-20062016.
This project explores what factors predict the revenue of a film and how well (if at all) can we predict the revenue of a film? Additionally, given that major 
films costing over millions to produce can still ‘flop’ in the box office, can we predict which films will be highly rated by users,
regardless of if they are a commercial success?
